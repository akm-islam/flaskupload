All services will be provided in collaboration with the client’s probation officer, who will remain the primary person responsible. Through this procurement, DOP is seeking a Provider to operate the IMPACT program, which has two main components. First, the provider’s field counselors would offer family services that assess, address, and help restructure the ways that parents and adolescents interact. Second, the provider would assign a mentor to each youth. The provider would recruit mentors who are familiar with the communities they serve and the resources and challenges therein.
