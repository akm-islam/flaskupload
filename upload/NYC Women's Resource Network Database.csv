Founded in 1996, by Executive Director Gail J. Davis, Round-The-Clock Nursery provides 24-hour/7 days-per-week childcare and was the first (and to this day), the only such institution in one of the most economically-disadvantaged communities in New York City. RCN is an educationally-focused, safe learning environment that enables parents with traditional or non-traditional work and/or educational schedules to pursue their goals. In addition, we provide emergency back-up services when parentâ€™s regular childcare arrangements fail. 
RCN is accrdited by the NAEYC (National Association of the Education for Young Children) 
The Need for RCN.  RCNâ€™s â€œparent-centeredâ€ child care services are urgently needed because existing child care services do not meet the needs of a significant segment of New York Cityâ€™s workforce. RCN was developed to address this service delivery gap. Our motto is â€œNo matter the time, we help grow strong mindsâ€. 

RCNâ€™s Mission Statement: Every child has the capacity to learn; every child has a right to a quality education; the learning process is a collaborative effort that requires the partnership of the child, the parent, and the educator and; children will excel academically in a nurturing, challenging, and interesting environment where their teachers have high expectations of them.","{'latitude': '40.813442', 'longitude': '-73.948979'}",MANHATTAN,40.813442,-73.948979,10.0,9.0,215.0,1084087.0,1019580001.0,Central Harlem North-Polo Grounds                                          ,12424.0,18.0,4.0,36.0,20.0,N,,

Working alongside youth, Day One educates, organizes and advocates on behalf of young people at risk of or experiencing intimate partner violence.

Day One focuses on young people because one in three teens experiences abuse in a dating relationship according to the United States Department of Justice. The most recent New York City Teen Health Risk Survey found that one in ten teenagers had experienced physical or sexual assault in a dating relationship within the previous year.

In each of our programs, Day One looks forward to new beginnings for youth. We engage young people in identifying methods of keeping themselves and their peers safe, and together envision a future without fear of abuse. Community involvement is critical to our ability to help young people. Please contact us to volunteer or make a contribution to support our services. 

Our Community Education Program offers interactive, law-based workshops that educate youth in public school classes, after-school programs and foster care group homes; we train social service providers, teachers and parents on domestic violence and the law. The Legal Services Program provides free and confidential information, advocacy and representation in family and criminal courts to youth between the ages of twelve and twenty-two. Day One conducts policy advocacy to increase rights for youth in local schools and the justice system. Through our Peer Leadership Program, we organize students and build leadership skills among college-aged youth. Students educate their peers, design education systems, develop materials, and perform outreach and advocacy. The Youth Voices Network is a group of survivors of relationship abuse, which channels the experiences of its members into building a safer future for other young people.

They aimed to transform a system that had allowed generations of students to leave school without the skills and knowledge they needed to succeed, turning it into a system of 1,400-plus excellent schools, capable of helping the Cityï¿½s 1.1 million school children learn the skills and receive the support they deserve and need to succeed.

We work to influence the eating habits of children through hands-on education that celebrates the connection to local farmers and the important tradition of sharing meals around the family table. 

Spoons Across America is a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization founded on the premise that it is essential to the health of our children and our society to bring the joys of the table to the children of America. The table is where children learn about conversation, consideration, tolerance and other tools for getting along in society. When activities are centered around healthful food, children experience a fun and exciting way to learn about nutrition, the physiology of taste, and how food weaves its way through daily life, from the farm to the table. 


Our programs encourage healthy eating.
How? All of the program recipes use a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are beneficial to long-term health and well-being.

Our programs encourage family meals.
How? Whenever possible, Spoons Across America curricula involve in-class and homework assignments that initiate family meals, encourage family participation, and enrich the family eating experience.

Our programs address the educational needs of children. How? Spoons Across America creates quality hands-on education programs that fulfill New York State educational standards and incorporates valuable life lessons.

In addition to being the first governmental agency of its type in the United States, OCME established the first toxicology laboratory in 1918 and the first serology laboratory in 1938, both at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. In 1933, New York University established the first Department of Forensic Medicine in the country. Since that date, Medical Examiners at OCME have held faculty positions in NYU's Forensic Medicine department. OCME's administrative offices were in the Municipal Building from 1918 to 1934, and at 125 Worth Street from 1934 to 1960; autopsies were performed at Bellevue Hospital and other borough municipal hospitals during those years. In 1960, OCME's six-story headquarters at 520 First Avenue (northeast corner of First Avenue and 30th Street) opened on land provided by New York University, adjacent to NYU Medical Center. In 1968 the Institute of Forensic Medicine of New York University and the City of New York was created; in 1977 the Institute was named after the late Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner from 1954 to 1973. The Institute is comprised of OCME, the New York University School of Medicine, and the New York University College of Dentistry. OCME's headquarters at 520 First Avenue houses executive offices, the mortuary, autopsy rooms, X-Ray/photography facilities, as well as toxicology and histology laboratories. In February 2007, OCME opened the OCME DNA Building located at 421 East 26 Street (east of First Avenue), which houses state of the art Forensic Biology laboratories, as well as OCMEï¿½s Administrative unit and Evidence facilities including a forensic garage to examine vehicles for forensic evidence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,

In January 2005, Mayor Bloomberg created the Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses to retain and grow the sector's job base, execute the goals of the industrial policy, and serve as a single point of coordination for the industrial and manufacturing sector. The sector provides close to 500,000 jobs in New York City, making up nearly 15% of the city's workforce, and contributed $1.7 billion in tax revenues in 2004. The manufacturing and industrial sector is not only a strong component of our economy but a reliable source of jobs for many of our fellow New Yorkers. More than half of the employees in the industrial sector have a high school diploma or less and nearly a fifth have limited English proficiency. New York City is a strategic location to operate an industrial business. The unparalleled concentration of residents, businesses, economic activity, and wealth creates a tremendous end market for the industrial sector. Every employer praises the New York City workforce for its unparalleled diversity, depth of talent, commitment, and proactive attitude. Despite these advantages, challenges remain for the sector. Space to expand or relocate is expensive and scarce, operating costs are high, and there is a perception that the overall business environment presents obstacles. Our Office has begun to address these issues. Our Office broadened the Commercial Expansion Program to create benefits especially for industrial and manufacturing businesses that rent their spaces. In early 2006 our Office created 16 Industrial Business Zones across the City where expanded business services are available for industrial and manufacturing businesses. A relocation tax credit of $1,000 per employee is offered for manufacturing and industrial businesses that choose to relocate within the Industrial Business Zones.ï¿½ Moreover, the zones represent areas where the Bloomberg Administration guarantees it will prohibit any new residential development. And State tax credits are also available to qualified businesses located in certain Industrial Business Zones as a result of the recent reconfiguration of the New York City's Empire Zones. Our Office intends to see these initiatives grow and better serve the cityï¿½s industrial and manufacturing businesses. We encourage you to explore this site to learn more.

path to self-sufficiency by giving them the skills to succeed, supporting
and strengthening their families and, when necessary, supplementing their families.

The programs operated by Graham Windham are inspired by one single steadfast vision of a city where children are protected from pain and suffering and are free to mature in safe and loving homes. All of our pioneering initiatives over our 200 years of uninterrupted service to New York's neediest children and families grow out of a commitment to making this vision real for the thousands of citizens we serve each year.

We recognize that the children we serve today face an array of challenges and difficulties - often dire - that will jeopardize their ability to survive, grow and prosper if left unaddressed. First and foremost, they need safe and caring homes, followed by professional assistance to help them with their problems and real opportunities to learn and develop and to expand their horizons. Today's Graham Windham continues to experiment, innovate and expand its broad spectrum of multidisciplinary services to include whatever it takes to enable children and their families to triumph over conditions that put their chances for learning, growing and staying together at risk.

Nowhere is the barrier to success and wellbeing more apparent than in the area of education and literacy. Education is still the best ticket out of poverty and limited opportunity and the children we server all too often get the least our American educational system has to offer. Fully understanding the crushing nature of this disadvantage, Graham Windham has added educational supports and literacy enhancements to every one of its programs up and down the continuum of care. Ensuring that all our children have the tools and assistance needed to master their potential has become our signature goal.

Throughout its proud 200 year history, Graham Windham has been on the front lines of child welfare policy and practice. We take a back seat to no one when it comes to the health and welfare of the children and families we serve. This remains true today and will remain true tomorrow. We are committed to continued quality improvement - for our children and families, their home communities and for this distinguished and historic child welfare agency.","{'latitude': '40.735203', 'longitude': '-73.987898'}",MANHATTAN,40.735203,-73.987898,5.0,2.0,50.0,1017814.0,1008710068.0,Gramercy                                                                   ,11724.0,11.0,4.0,50.0,7.0,Y,7th Floor,Hastings-on-Hudson

Innovative and collaborative, the BOC Network works to close the credit and technical-assistance gap limiting the growth potential and job-creation capacities of microentrepreneurs and small businesses of hard-working men and women who operate in isolation from the mainstream market and whose businesses are an important source of jobs in their largely minority and immigrant communities. By stimulating the growth of profitable enterprises, the BOC Network helps to recirculate capital through neighborhood economies, and so to revitalize whole communities.

Individually and in concert, the BOC Network's growing alliance of Business Outreach Centers, or BOCs, connect local entrepreneurs to the full complement of business assistance services, as well as to financial, legal, and other resources. In the process, they successfully guide them through the process of starting and developing their enterprises, and then follow-up with them as they progress and their needs evolve.

Speaking the languages of the communities they serve, individual BOCs have proven to be ideally suited to reach and extend a guiding hand to local entrepreneurs whose challenges are many and resources few. BOC business counselors provide one-on-one needs assessment, business planning, marketing and management guidance, as well as access to resources through the BOC Network's extensive linkages with the full spectrum of public and private business assistance sources.

Moreover, the BOC Network serves as a highly interactive forum for sharing technology and resources across community and cultural lines, enabling local entrepreneurs to familiarize themselves with the latest business practices, to forge meaningful links with mainstream services, markets, and mentors, and to gain access to new business-development opportunities.

In other words, the BOC Network makes connections that make the system work for local entrepreneurs, communities, regions, service providers, and the economy as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,

The Power of Culture is of everyone 

History 

The Dominican Foundation Culturarte of New York was founded in June 20th, 2001 under the guidance of Dr. Jorge Pi,a psychotherapist and poet and with visual artist and poet, Karina Rieke. The organization believes that participation and education in the arts helps create mature, emotionally and intellectually well-rounded individuals. 

The Center's School of the Arts offers weekly classes and seminars on music, dance, theater, painting, film, photography, poetry, creative writing, journalism and literature. Through participation in classes and performance groups, students learn discipline and healthy self-expression. Our students, adults and young people, use the skills and talents developed in arts training as an artistic alternative to the prevention of violence, drug abuse, low-educational attainment levels, poverty and other issues that plague our community. Culturarte's goal is to create a well-educated, healthy, and creative community. 

Located in the heart of Washington Heights, Culturarte serves members of the over 400,000-immigrant community from South and Central America and the Caribbean. Providing artistic educational services keeps participants in touch with their heritage, while acting as a bridge to the culture and environment of the United States and New York City. For first-and second-generation members of the community, the ills of the inner-city often supplant the values of their native culture.

The objectives of this State-wide initiative was: 1) through the operation of a crisis intervention center, to stabilize volatile situations for families and individuals in crisis situations or to address situations that if left unaddressed could become crisis, and 2) to improve long-term economic and social conditions through the development and implementation of a Strategic Neighborhood Action Plan (SNAP).  

Since 1993, over 2,000 individuals and families have been placed in decent, affordable apartments, over 4,000 families have averted homelessness, over 2,000 families have avoided serious injury or death, have been placed in safe houses, and have secured monetary compensation and over 1,000 individuals have received HIV/AIDS services.

Although the EHNBAC downscaled its operation after NYS Neighborhood Based Alliance Initiative sunset in 1996 it continues to serve approximately 600 individuals and families per year.  Most staff are bilingual in Spanish and English.  

The EHNBAC provides crime victims with legal advocacy, family court advocacy around divorce, child visitation, child support, orders of protection.  We accompany participants to precincts, court, and the District Attorney?s Office.  

Emergency Assistance for Victims
We provide emergency services such as the changing of locks, purchase of furniture, clothing, pampers, food and payment of legal and documentation fees to regain lost or missing identification and legal documents, relocation assistance, and rent assistance if the victim is at risk of eviction.  

We provide advocacy to obtain repairs, initiation of overcharge claims, tenant landlord mediation, money management training, legal advocacy, and assistance in securing and maintaining entitlements and benefits.  

In July 2005, in response to the high rates of HIV/AIDS in East Harlem, the EHNBAC instituted its HIV/AIDS education program known as Awareness Can Change Every Persons Tomorrow (ACCEPT).  Since then, over 900 individuals have received education and services focusing on the prevention of HIV/AIDS.  The EHNBAC ACCEPT program provides case management, crisis intervention services, prevention workshops, individual and family counseling sessions, referrals to treatment at local hospitals and medical centers in the community, information and referral,  permanency planning and condom distribution. 
 
Its Homelessness Prevention Program aims to prevent eviction through Housing Court representation, tenant/landlord mediation and emergency cash assistance paid directly to landlords or utility providers.  

If relocation is the appropriate alternative, the EHNBAC will secure alternative housing placement for families where eviction cannot be avoided.","{'latitude': '40.801647', 'longitude': '-73.935017'}",MANHATTAN,40.801647,-73.935017,11.0,8.0,194.0,1054629.0,1017870080.0,East Harlem North                                                          ,13093.0,7.0,4.0,35.0,16.0,N,,

Enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act originally was a retirement program intended to provide financial support for elderly workers who coould no longer perform gainful labor.  In more than half a century since its enactment, coverage has been added for other groups of workers.  Social  Security also administers a needs based program called Supplemental Security Income(SSI) for those who do not have sufficient coverage to entitle them to Social Security benefits and who meet certain income and resource limits. 
Nearly 60 percent of the people receiving Social Security benefits are women.  In the 21st century, more women work, pay Social security taxes and earn credit toward their own monthly retirement income than in any other time in our nation's history. Women tend to care for many people including spouses, children and parents.  Women are more likely to earn less over their lifetimes than men.  Women are less often covered by private retirement plans and more dependent on Social Security- and for a longer period of time since, on average, women live about five years longer than men. When women work, they pay taxes into the Social Security system, providing their own benefits. Women who do not work are often covered through their husbands' work and can receive benefits based on their current husband or prior husband's work record when they retire, become disabled or die. Women should remember to contact Social Security to correct the information Social Security has for them, if they change their name through divorce or marriage
For information on benefits, entitlement, and eligibility go to www.socialsecurity.gov/women. The web site has a specific section devoted to women's issues. At age 65, most women will be eligible for Medicare Par A if they are eligible for benefits on their own record or on their husband's record.  Women will have the opportunity to buy Medicare medical insurance (Part B) for a monthly premium.  If they are not eligible for a benefit because they do not have enough credits, they can purchase Medicare coverage by paying a monthly premium.

A group of certified social workers in the HIV field who were also part of the Network were concerned about the high rates of HIV among women of color, particularly immigrant Latinas, as there exists a gap in services for this hard to reach population due to immigration status, documentation status, language barrier, and cultural norms. Voces Latinas saw a need for more outreach, education, advocacy and resources in Spanish for this population. VL began raising money in order to hold conferences and forums in Queens targeting immigrant Latinas living with and at risk for HIV. This was an opportunity to invite the HIV specialist to come to Queens and talk to the population at hand, as it is often impossible for these women to attend conferences often times held in English and in other parts of the country. The response to the conferences and forums was so positive that Voces Latinas began holding bi-monthly community workshops around issues placing Latinas at high risk for HIV/AIDS such as domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse, depression, etc. These workshops quickly turned weekly. The workshops continue to be held weekly and also serve to provide an opportunity for Latinas to meet and provide each other emotional support and an opportunity to tell their stories, which for many of them is the first time ever openly talking about their lives.","{'latitude': '40.744161', 'longitude': '-73.914709'}",QUEENS   ,40.744161,-73.914709,2.0,26.0,25301.0,4001290.0,4001380040.0,Hunters Point-Sunnyside-West Maspeth                                       ,14787.0,53.0,3.0,33.0,66.0,N,Suite 2E,

Homework Help: This service is available daily for all participants, K-12, over-aged and under-credited participants. 
Small-group Study with Academic Specialists: Our certified teachers provide targeted support in reading, writing, math, science and global studies. We also provide remedial work for those who have begun college in the area and have requested our help. 
Arts and Culture Activities: These comprise dance, drama and poetry, photography, video/filmmaking and music recording. Middle- and high-school participants are recruited by FUEGO en la 106, our resident dance company, where they discover the world of dancing while learning about different cultures, the rigors of performing, teamwork and self-discipline. 
Creative Writing and Reading: By keeping weekly journals, participating in book clubs, engaging in scriptwriting and carrying out interviews, among other things, participants can learn new and interesting ways to express themselves on the page. 
Technology Access and Education: These activities promote computer, web-design and networking skills as well as general computer literacy. 
Science and Innovation: Featuring our award-winning FIRST Robotics Team (which, despite being East Harlem's first robotics team ever, managed to beat proven powerhouses like Stuyvesant HS and Bronx HS of Science to Nationals) and its middle school component, Lego Robotics. We are pleased to have just been included in the InvenTeam competition out of MIT. 
College and Career Preparation: We offer test prep, college tours, career exploration, SAT prep and Regents prep. 
Youth Development Activities: These provide young participants with much needed skills in conflict resolution, community activism, volunteering, youth governance, teamwork, time management and decision making. 
One-to-One Tutoring: Personalized tutoring remains a mainstay of our programming with weekly sessions, 11/2 hours per week. 
Recreation and Sports: These activities include basketball, table tennis and supervised park visits. 
Family Literacy Programming: Springing from a direct need voiced by the parents themselves, this service began this year with our first-ever ESL classes. We were thrilled to have advanced 26 parents from the first session. 
University Program: EHTP's University Program offers high-school students the opportunity to work with licensed teachers so that they can prepare for Regent exams and improve their chances to accumulate credits. Working hand in hand with staff members, they will identify college or career options and fulfill the necessary requirements to become competitive applicants for their school or career of choice.

Having established itself as a human rights organization, Dwa Fanm's mission is to empower all women and girls with the freedom to define and control their own lives. Through service, education, advocacy and grassroots programs, Dwa Fanm works to end discrimination, violence, and other forms of injustice in New York City and abroad. 
Dwa Fanm's members share a commitment to women's rights as well as to social and legal equality, justice, peace and democracy. We envision a world where women fully and equally participate in processes that favor their well-being and economic independence, where they have the freedom to define their lives and where all girls can develop to their full potential.

We oppose all forms of discrimination and exclusion due to sex, age, color, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, martial or parental status, physical ability, social class and economic status.

We support the right of women to fight exploitation and poverty. We believe women have the right to control their own bodies. We support a woman's right to have children and to not have children, to resist and denounce rape and incest, to marry whom they want to or not to marry. All women have value independent of their relationship to a man and deserve the respect of society. These values represent what many of us define as feminism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DRUM builds the power of our members, particularly youth and women, to win full civil and economic rights for immigrants, including legalization and an end to deportation policies.  

Our long-term vision is to build the power of immigrant workers in the U.S in unity with all low-wage workers and communities of color to win rights and dignity.

The population of the 116-city block cache area known as Crown Heights is comprised of persons of many cultures and includes new immigrants. According to the 1990 census, incomes tend to be low - often below poverty levels. Housing is mostly old (circa 1900 - 1930) and at a premium. CHJCC administers programs, advocates for clients, and provides referrals on issues of housing, employment, economic development, entitlements, problems of the aging, aid to crime victims, assistance for indigent residents. CHJCC has created multi-racial, faith, and community-based programs such as Project Care, which unites civic and religious leaders from every segment of the community in a funded program to promote efforts in social and economic development. Creative initiatives such as Project Care have addressed areas of common concern, and new avenues of communication and cooperation have emerged. One of the major goals of the CHJCC is to promote an atmosphere of understanding and cooperation in the community. Areas of common concern, including housing, poverty, crime, employment, education and economic development, are being addressed through new programs.","{'latitude': '40.665708', 'longitude': '-73.942532'}",BROOKLYN ,40.665708,-73.942532,9.0,35.0,333.0,3034315.0,3013000010.0,Crown Heights South                                                        ,17615.0,17.0,2.0,48.0,44.0,,,

SingleStop bridges the information gap separating low-income families from life-changing public benefits, tax credits and other essential services that remain untapped and inaccessible. These basic resources - food, health insurance, child care and tax refunds - increase the likelihood that families are healthy and stable, with parents who work and children who attend school.

SingleStop USA is the ambitious nationwide expansion of SingleStop NY, a remarkably successful program launched by the Robin Hood Foundation to connect the working poor in New York with government funds and services intended for them.

Incorporated as a non-profit in March, 2007, SingleStop USA encompasses the existing New York program, as well new efforts throughout the country. In its first five years, SingleStop USA will deliver $2 billion in benefits to up to a million households.

These efforts change the way America combats poverty by focusing on prevention rather than intervention. Benefits provide a cushion against the small setbacks - a sick child, car trouble, temporary job loss - that can become catastrophes in the lives of the working poor.","{'latitude': '40.805258', 'longitude': '-73.938875'}",MANHATTAN,40.805258,-73.938875,11.0,9.0,196.0,1054472.0,1017740001.0,East Harlem North                                                          ,13093.0,7.0,4.0,36.0,16.0,N,Suite 503,
